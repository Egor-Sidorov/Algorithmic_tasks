# Algorithmic_tasks
Here are collected the most difficult tasks wich I solved during the course "Algorithms: theory and practice. Methods" (link - https://stepik.org/course/217).
All solutions have been tested with strict time and memory constraints, which guarantees the efficiency of the presented algorithms.
Some functions are poorly documented and difficult to read, as they solve some abstract mathematical problems.
